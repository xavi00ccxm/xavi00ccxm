# Otto X. De La Rocha — SQL Server (SSMS) + Data Architecture | Power BI + Excel Reporting

I build end-to-end analytics solutions: stakeholder requirements → data modeling → ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) → SQL queries → Power BI and Excel dashboards.

## Core focus: SQL Server (SSMS) + Data Architecture

I build reliable SQL Server data foundations and turn them into stakeholder-ready decision reporting. My work spans data modeling (star schema), ETL (Extract, Transform, Load), SQL validation/quality checks, and scalable architecture patterns—delivered through Power BI and Excel dashboards that make KPIs, trends, and variances easy to act on.

### Where I add the most value
- **SSMS / SQL Server:** SQL development, ETL pipelines, dimensional modeling (star schema), performance tuning basics, data quality checks
- **Data Architecture:** modeling standards, governance-aware design, integration patterns, documentation, repeatable frameworks
- **Power BI Reporting:** executive dashboards, KPI design, drill-through/slicers, trend + variance (MoM/YoY), exception monitoring, summary statistics
- **Excel Dashboards:** dynamic dashboards (PivotTables/Power Pivot), refreshable reporting, formulas (XLOOKUP, INDEX-MATCH), stakeholder-ready exports
- **Delivery:** translate business questions into metrics, define KPIs clearly, produce clean stakeholder-ready outputs
