# Otto (Xavier) De La Rocha — Power BI + SQL (SSMS) Portfolio

I build end-to-end analytics solutions: stakeholder requirements → data modeling → ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) → SQL queries → Power BI dashboards.

## Core focus: SQL Server (SSMS) + Data Architecture

I specialize in designing reliable SQL Server data foundations and turning them into stakeholder-ready analytics.
My work centers on: data modeling (star schema), ETL (Extract, Transform, Load), SQL validation/quality checks,
and architecture patterns that scale.

**Where I add the most value**
- **SSMS / SQL Server:** SQL development, ETL pipelines, dimensional modeling, performance tuning basics, data quality checks
- **Data Architecture:** modeling standards, governance-aware design, integration patterns, documentation, and repeatable frameworks
- **Analytics Delivery:** translating business questions into metrics, clear definitions, and clean reporting outputs
